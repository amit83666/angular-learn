I have a creative mind and am always seeking for fresh, new approaches to enhance the work I perform. I completed numerous outside-the-box tasks for a Techsee project, and I welcome all comments and advice. The organization will continue to benefit from my ingenuity, and I am eager to see what the future brings.

When I code, I think about ways to make my code more readable and scalable for others. I'll make a comment in the code if I see any particularly difficult sections. usage of OOP principles for reuse and modularity. I use a variety of approaches to optimize the code, including dry and solid.I typically try to read other people's web code in order to learn the most recent coding skills.

I constantly work to express complicated ideas clearly and concisely while actively listening to the other person and taking the time to grasp their point of view.
I have no problem conversing with anyone, and I also use nonverbal cues to communicate effectively.

My responsibilities and job are crystal apparent to me. I have a purpose in mind when I work. I abide by all corporate regulations. I stay current on the newest developments and insights in my industry. I arrive on time and remain active while at work. I ask for help when I need it to solve issues. I prioritize my work and give priority to the most crucial activities first.


I always improve my skills; prior to working at Softobiz, all I knew was javascript and nodejs. I learn other frameworks like nestjs, reactjs, and nextjs within a year. I constantly work to enhance my skills, therefore I also learn the stuff that the firm uses more frequently, such as DDD boilerplate and Ory Kratos.and make an effort to learn something new every day.
I use resources like YouTube, Udemy, Google, and ChatGPT to study. I also connect with people in related fields to get advice.

I always take part in activities at the organizational level. if the duty relates to work or recreational activities. I always complete all necessary tasks, such as filling out forms, download authenticator app etc, on time and in advance. Participating in a fun activity that takes place inside or outside of the office, such as playing cricket, table tennis, marathon, painting, crafting, or making rangoli etc. I socialize with coworkers at work, so I am familiar with everyone.


I had planned to learn frameworks like nestjs, nextjs, DDD boilerplate, or ory kratos in my most recent quarter, which I did as well as implemented in POC.

Yes, but I also seek advice from team members and online resources to help me with these challenges.
